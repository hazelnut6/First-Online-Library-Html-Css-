        <h4>Dante Alighieri</h4>
        An Italian poet, writer and philosopher. Because Danteâ€™s poetic persona looms so large in his writings, very little can be said about his biography that does not, in some way, depend upon an interpretation of his continual re-crafting of that persona. It is generally accepted that Dante was born in 1265 in Florence. According to the testimony of his own writings, at the age of nine he met for the first time the eight-year-old Beatrice Portinari, whom, subsequent to her death in 1290, Dante consistently invoked as the key inspiration for his poetic vision and personal salvation.<br>

        <p><h3><b>Herman Melville</b></h3></p>
        <p class="space" >Herman Melville was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. Among his best-known works are Moby-Dick; Typee, a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia; and Billy Budd, Sailor, a posthumously published novella.
            Although his reputation was not high at the time of his death, the 1919 centennial of his birth was the starting point of a Melville revival, and Moby-Dick grew to be considered one of the great American novels.
